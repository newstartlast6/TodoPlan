# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds comprehensive time tracking capabilities to the todo application, allowing users to track time spent on individual tasks and monitor daily progress toward an 8-hour target. The system provides a global timer that can switch between tasks, maintains accurate timing even when the application is backgrounded or closed, and presents a clean, minimalistic interface for time management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to start and pause a timer for any task, so that I can accurately track the time I spend working on specific activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks a "Start Timer" button on a task THEN the system SHALL begin tracking time for that specific task
2. WHEN a timer is running THEN the system SHALL display the current elapsed time in real-time
3. WHEN a user clicks "Pause Timer" THEN the system SHALL stop the timer and preserve the accumulated time
4. WHEN a user resumes a paused timer THEN the system SHALL continue from the previously accumulated time
5. IF a task already has accumulated time THEN the timer SHALL display the total time including previous sessions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to set an initial estimated duration for tasks, so that I can plan my work and track progress against my estimates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating or editing a task THEN the system SHALL provide options to set estimated duration (30min, 1hr, 2hr, custom)
2. WHEN a timer is running THEN the system SHALL show progress against the estimated duration
3. IF actual time exceeds estimated duration THEN the system SHALL indicate the task is over the estimate
4. WHEN viewing a task THEN the system SHALL display both estimated and actual time spent

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to switch timers between tasks with confirmation, so that I can work on multiple tasks while maintaining accurate time tracking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a timer is already running for one task and user starts timer for another task THEN the system SHALL show a confirmation popup
2. WHEN user confirms timer switch THEN the system SHALL pause the current timer and start the new timer
3. WHEN user cancels timer switch THEN the system SHALL keep the current timer running
4. IF no timer is currently running THEN starting a new timer SHALL not require confirmation
5. WHEN switching timers THEN the system SHALL preserve all accumulated time for both tasks

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see daily time summaries and progress toward my 8-hour target, so that I can monitor my productivity and ensure I meet my daily goals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the daily summary THEN the system SHALL display total time spent across all tasks for the current day
2. WHEN viewing the daily summary THEN the system SHALL show remaining time needed to reach the 8-hour target
3. WHEN the 8-hour target is reached THEN the system SHALL provide visual confirmation of goal completion
4. WHEN viewing task details THEN the system SHALL show time spent on each individual task for the current day
5. IF daily target is exceeded THEN the system SHALL display the overtime amount

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the timer to work reliably even when I switch tabs, minimize the application, or close it temporarily, so that my time tracking remains accurate regardless of how I use my computer.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is backgrounded or tab is switched THEN the timer SHALL continue running accurately
2. WHEN the application is closed and reopened THEN the system SHALL restore the timer state and calculate elapsed time
3. WHEN the browser crashes or system restarts THEN the system SHALL recover timer state from the last known start time
4. WHEN calculating elapsed time THEN the system SHALL use server timestamps to ensure accuracy
5. IF network connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL queue timer events and sync when connection is restored

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want a clean and minimalistic timer interface that doesn't clutter my workspace, so that I can focus on my tasks while still having easy access to time tracking controls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a timer is running THEN the system SHALL display a subtle, non-intrusive timer indicator
2. WHEN viewing the timer interface THEN the system SHALL use clean typography and minimal visual elements
3. WHEN interacting with timer controls THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual feedback for all actions
4. WHEN multiple tasks have active time THEN the system SHALL organize the display in a scannable, hierarchical format
5. IF the timer interface becomes too large THEN the system SHALL provide collapsible sections to maintain focus

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view historical time tracking data, so that I can analyze my productivity patterns and improve my time management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a task THEN the system SHALL display total time spent across all sessions
2. WHEN viewing daily summaries THEN the system SHALL show time breakdowns by task
3. WHEN viewing time history THEN the system SHALL preserve data across browser sessions
4. WHEN exporting time data THEN the system SHALL provide the information in a readable format
5. IF time tracking data exists THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity during application updates
