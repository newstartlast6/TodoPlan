# Design Document

## Overview

This design document outlines the visual and interaction improvements for the lists panel and selectable todos interface. The design focuses on modern UI patterns, smooth animations, and improved user experience while maintaining the existing functionality and layout structure.

## Architecture

The design improvements will be implemented through CSS/styling updates and minor component modifications without changing the core data flow or state management architecture. The improvements target three main areas:

1. **Lists Panel Styling** - Enhanced visual design for list items and interactions
2. **Todo Selection System** - Improved selection feedback and animations  
3. **Inline Task Creation** - Streamlined task addition workflow

## Components and Interfaces

### Lists Panel Component Updates

**Visual Design Changes:**
- Card-based styling with subtle shadows and rounded corners
- Improved spacing with consistent padding (12px vertical, 16px horizontal)
- Enhanced hover states with smooth color transitions
- Active list highlighting with orange accent border and background

**Interactive Elements:**
- Edit/delete buttons with opacity-based reveal on hover
- Search input with proper icon positioning and focus states
- Smooth transitions (200ms) for all interactive elements

### Todo Items Component Updates

**Selection System:**
- Selected todos get orange left border (4px) and light orange background
- Slide-in-right animation (0.3s) when selection changes
- Subtle right-shift effect (2px transform) for selected items
- Selection highlight with sliding animation overlay

**Visual Hierarchy:**
- Consistent typography scaling (title: font-medium, description: text-sm)
- Priority indicators with colored dots (red: high, yellow: medium, green: low)
- Due date and time information with proper icon alignment
- Completed todos with reduced opacity (75%) and strikethrough

### Inline Task Creation

**Input Design:**
- Persistent input field at bottom of todo list
- Dashed border styling to indicate "add new" functionality
- Placeholder text: "Add a new task..."
- Focus state with orange border highlight

**Interaction Flow:**
- Enter key creates new todo and clears input
- Auto-focus management for seamless task creation
- Visual feedback during task creation process

## Data Models

No changes to existing data models are required. The improvements are purely visual and interaction-based, working with the current todo and list data structures.

## Error Handling

**Input Validation:**
- Empty task titles should show subtle validation feedback
- Network errors during task creation should display inline error messages
- Failed task creation should restore input content for retry

**Animation Fallbacks:**
- Reduced motion preferences should disable animations
- CSS fallbacks for browsers without animation support
- Graceful degradation for older browsers

## Testing Strategy

### Visual Testing
- Cross-browser compatibility testing for animations and transitions
- Responsive design testing across different screen sizes
- Accessibility testing for keyboard navigation and screen readers

### Interaction Testing
- Selection state management across different user flows
- Animation timing and smoothness validation
- Input field behavior and form submission testing

### Performance Testing
- Animation performance monitoring (60fps target)
- CSS optimization for smooth transitions
- Memory usage validation for animation effects

## Implementation Details

### CSS Animation Classes

```css
/* Selection highlight effects */
.todo-select-highlight {
  position: relative;
  overflow: hidden;
}

.todo-select-highlight::before {
  content: '';
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: -100%;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  background: linear-gradient(90deg, transparent, rgba(255, 165, 0, 0.1), transparent);
  transition: left 0.5s ease-in-out;
}

.todo-select-highlight.selected::before {
  left: 100%;
}

/* Slide-in animation for selection */
.slide-in-right {
  animation: slideInRight 0.3s ease-out;
}

@keyframes slideInRight {
  from {
    transform: translateX(10px);
    opacity: 0;
  }
  to {
    transform: translateX(0);
    opacity: 1;
  }
}
```

### Color Scheme
- Primary Orange: #FF6B35
- Light Orange: #FFF5F3
- Orange Border: #FF6B35
- Gray Primary: #2D3748
- Gray Secondary: #718096
- Gray Light: #F7FAFC

### Spacing System
- Base unit: 4px
- Small spacing: 8px (2 units)
- Medium spacing: 12px (3 units)
- Large spacing: 16px (4 units)
- Extra large: 24px (6 units)

### Typography Scale
- Large title: text-xl (20px)
- Medium title: text-lg (18px)
- Body text: text-base (16px)
- Small text: text-sm (14px)
- Extra small: text-xs (12px)

## Accessibility Considerations

- Maintain proper color contrast ratios (WCAG AA compliance)
- Ensure keyboard navigation works with new interactive elements
- Provide screen reader announcements for selection changes
- Support reduced motion preferences for animations
- Maintain focus management during state transitions
