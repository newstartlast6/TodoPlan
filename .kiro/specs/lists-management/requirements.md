# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a comprehensive Lists management system to the calendar application, providing users with a dedicated interface to organize their tasks into custom lists. The Lists feature will mirror the modern, minimalistic design of the existing week view while introducing a 3-panel layout for efficient list and task management. Users will be able to create, organize, and manage multiple lists with emoji icons, each containing their own set of todos that integrate seamlessly with the existing task system.

### Requirement 3
